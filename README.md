# SPEEDI.R - Simulation Package for Efficient Experimental Design and Inference in R

R package developed by David J Price and Olivier Restif

## Description

Suite of modelling and analytical tools for the study of bacterial infection dynamics within hosts, using stochastic birth-death-migration models.

Current functions as of October 2017:

- run stochastic simulations (using the adaptivetau package),
- compute the lower moments of a multi-compartment birth-death-migration model (linear, continuous time Markov model),
- estimate the model's parameters by minimising the divergence between observed and predicted distributions of bacteria. 

Future functions:

- model comparison
- optimal experimental design
